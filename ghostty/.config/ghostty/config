# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /home/yong/.config/ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
palette = 0=#15161e
palette = 1=#f7768e
palette = 2=#9ece6a
palette = 3=#e0af68
palette = 4=#7aa2f7
palette = 5=#bb9af7
palette = 6=#7dcfff
palette = 7=#a9b1d6
palette = 8=#414868
palette = 9=#ff899d
palette = 10=#9fe044
palette = 11=#faba4a
palette = 12=#8db0ff
palette = 13=#c7a9ff
palette = 14=#a4daff
palette = 15=#c0caf5

background = #1a1b26
foreground = #c0caf5
cursor-color = #c0caf5
selection-background = #283457
selection-foreground = #c0caf5
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = false
shell-integration-features = no-cursor
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
